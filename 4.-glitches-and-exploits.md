# 4. Glitches and Exploits

## General Gameplay

1. Drop-Ports are never allowed.

## Map Glitches

Map-specific glitches (e.g. getting inside buildings with no doors or places where one cannot be killed) are generally not allowed, with the following exceptions:

1. Venice docks: standing on the ledge at the edge of the water-side part of Venice is always allowed.
2. Castel Gandolfo chase breakers: using chandeliers to jump through chase breakers is always allowed.&#x20;
3. Rome statue: jumping on the statue in Rome is allowed. You are not allowed to Port on it.&#x20;
4.

Generally, glitches where one can stand on a ledge with slight elevation (like the Venice docks glitch described above) are always allowed.
