# 3. Host

As the host's connection has an impact on the game, during tournament matches, the game host is to be changed after every game unless all players participating in the match agree to keep playing with the same host.

#### What host controls and can affect:

* The contract system is host-dependent.
* Kills and stuns registering are host-dependent.

#### What host does _not_ control and _cannot_ affect:

* The connection between two players, including abilities, player locations etc.
